# Rcan

Rcan functions are design at {https://www.iarc.fr/en/research-groups/sec1/index.php the Cancer Surveillance Unit at International Agency for Research on Cancer}. The goal is to provide tools for scientist and other fellows using cancer epidemiological data. 

* calculate Age-Standardized Rate (ASR) and Truncated Age-Stadardized Rate (TASR) across different population (Registry, year, sex...).
* calculate and plot Age-Specific Rate
* calculate and plot Age-Specific Rate for the top X cancer or top X population
* plot cancer statistics over year.
* calculate the Estimated Annual Percentage Change (EAPC) of rates during a time period with the Confidence Intervalle (CI) across different population (Registry, year, sex...).
* plot cohort period age specific graph.



## Example

Here an example to calculate Age-standardized rate:

```{r example}
library(Rcan)
data(csu_registry_data_1)

# Age standardized rate (ASR) with no missing age cases.
result <- csu_asr(csu_registry_data_1, 
                  "age", "cases", "py",
                  group_by = c("registry", "registry_label" ),
                  var_age_group = c("registry_label"))
```
